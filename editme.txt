// Don't go crazy keeping this format correct, as long as I can piece it together in the end is all that matters.
// When you see a '0' here it actually indicates enneagram 9 for reasons you probably don't care about.

// The first 9 statements I tried to base on the information on each found at https://www.enneagraminstitute.com/
// I think it would be good to have at least two statements that are specific to one enneagram
// The rest are all triads, but statements can be any group: pairs, four, five, whatever.  Although realistically
// if you have a statement for 5 of 9 enneagrams it should probably be 'inverted' in some way so that it is a
// statement about the other 4.  The more statements the merrier, and ideally they will all have the same sort of
// heft to them, For example if you ever saw the statements "I like feeling safe" and "I am a champion of the
// opressed and work tirelessly to bring about positive change in my community" you might be compelled to pick the
// first just because the second is so intense.  So phrasing like "I like to feel safe" and "I like to improve the
// world around me" is a bit more balanced.
